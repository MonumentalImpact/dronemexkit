# dronemexkit
DroneMex is a DIY Drone Kit ideated and developed by interns with Monumental Impact / Bearbotics for students interested in learning about drones and customizing their own drone.  

Starter Kits with motors and electronics are sold to get students started. Students can then design and customize.

The first released version of the DroneMex Kit was the Summer of 2022 during a DIY Drones Workshop hosted by Monumental Impact / Bearbotics at their space at Grace Best in Monument, Colorado.
